# Customer Segmentation
Identify Customers from a Mailout Campaign.

This project is based on the data from Arvato Financial Solutions (https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers/data). In the project, a mail-order sales company in Germany is interested in identifying segments of the general population to target with their marketing in order to grow.

The objective is to identify which individuals are most likely to respond to the campaign and become customers of the mail-order company.
